# Analyzing the Number of Living Organ Donors with Respect to Donor Age and Gender
## Background
For this anlaysis, the number of living organ donors is being examined.  [Living organ donors](https://www.kidney.org/transplantation/livingdonors/general-information-living-donation#:~:text=Living%20donation%20takes%20place%20when,sister%20(living%20related%20donation).) are people who donate an organ or part of an organ while they are alive.  Living donors can donate an entire kidney or parts of their lung, liver, or pancreas to family members, friends, or strangers in need.  I became interested in organ transplants since I want to pursue a career in tissue engineering and artificial organ engineering.  Despite many advancements in 3D bioprinting organs, these artificial organs are not yet approved to be implanted into humans in need.  According to the [Health Resources and Services Administration](https://www.organdonor.gov/statistics-stories/statistics.html), "17 people die each day waiting for an organ transplant".  Therefore, organ donation is extremely important and more research needs to be conducted to find ways to recruit more organ donors.  In these analyses, we will investigate the affect that age and gender has on the number of living donors.  The goal is to see if we can predict how many living donors there are given the ages and genders of a group of people.  This could provide insight into age groups and genders that can be better marketed to to gain more donors.
